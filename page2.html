<h3>Sabre Tooth Tigers</h3>
<p>Time period and Geography</p>

<ul>
    <li>Sabre tooth tigers went extinct about 10,000 years ago</li>
    <li>They could be found in North America and Europe, however by Pliocene times, they had spread to Asia and Africa</li>
</ul>

<p>About Sabre Tooth Tigers</p>
<ul>
    <li> The most widely known genus of sabre-toothed cats is Smilodon, also called the “sabre-toothed tiger.” They are are characterized by long, curved saber-shaped canine teeth which protruded from the mouth when closed.</li>
    <li>"Several physical adaptations of Smilodon suggest such a hunting technique: its skull was modified to accommodate the attachment of strong neck muscles for bringing the head down; the lower canines were reduced; and the molars formed shearing blades with no trace of grinding surfaces. In addition, the jaw could be opened to about a 90° angle to free the upper canines for action; however, some paleontologists suggest that since the muscles in the jaw would have had to stretch significantly to enable such a wide gape, they would have been relatively weak compared with those of modern cats."</li>

<h4>Megalodon</h4>

<p>Time period and Geography</p>
<ul>
    <li>The megalodon became extinct around 2.6 million years ago due to climate change and changing ecosystem</li>
    <li> "Found in shallow tropical and temperate seas along the coastlines and continental shelf regions of all continents except Antarctica."</li>
</ul>
<p>About Megalodons:</p>
<ul>
    <li> It is an extinct species of mackerel shark and it got the name "megalodon" because it means “big tooth” in ancient greek</li>
    <li>It measured up to 60 feet long, making it one of the biggest predators to ever live</li>
</ul>
